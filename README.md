## How Grid Trading Works
- Price Range: Define upper and lower price limits
- Grid Lines: Range divided into equally spaced price levels
- Order Placement: Buy orders below current price, sell orders above
- Profit Generation: Buy low, sell high within small movements

### Example Grid Setup
```
Range: $40,000 - $42,000
Grid spacing: $200
At $41,000:
- Buy orders: $40,800, $40,600, $40,400...
- Sell orders: $41,200, $41,400, $41,600...
```

### Key Considerations
- Works best in sideways/ranging markets
- Requires sufficient funds for multiple orders
- Risk of holding positions outside range
- Grid spacing affects profit per trade vs frequency
- Fee considerations for profitability

## Development
